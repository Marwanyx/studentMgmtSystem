1. CD into the project directories (frontend AND backend) using two terminals
2. Run npm install in each of the directories (both frontend and backend)
3. In the backend directory, do "npm install nodemon"
3. Run "npm start" to run the frontend application (while in the frontend terminal)
4. Run "npm run dev" to run the backend api (while in the backend terminal)

# Student Result Management System

To run the program, begin by opening two seperate terminals.

In each of the terminals CD into frontend in one of them and CD into backend in one of them.

It should look like this,

Next, Run "npm install" in each of the directories (both frontend and backend terminals)

In the backend terminal do "npm install nodemon"

Finally, in the frontend terminal run "npm start" to run the frontend application (while in the frontend terminal) and run "npm run dev" to run the backend api (while in the backend terminal).
This will automatically open up the program in localhost:3000, if it does not open up automatically. Go into any browser and go to "http://localhost:3000/"
